	<h1> Goldfish Tea Site Redesign</h1>
	<br>
	<p>My Role: Project Manager, User testing facilitator, Visual Designer, Interactive Designer 
	<br>

	<br>
	Techniques Used: Heuristic analysis, User Testing, Interaction Design, Prototyping.</p>

	<h2>About Goldfish</h2>

	<p>Goldfish Tea is a tea house cafe located in Metro Detroit. It not only provides a warm beverage and a smile, but a space where customers of all ages can spend time with friends and family, and study. It also gives other local businesses the opportunity to sell their products. Goldfish prides itself on embodying ideal sense of community. As a regular customer and tea lover, I enjoy their beverages and the atmosphere of the cafe. I consider this as one of my favorites places to study.</p>

	<h2> Problem Statement</h2>

	<p>Responding to COVID-19 business restrictions, Goldfish Tea has developed a new online ordering system where customers can order and pickup their drinks. Even though this new ordering system is a facelift from their original website, I felt that some of the features could be improved to make it more user-friendly. I also wanted to take this on as a design challenge to enhance my skills.</p>
	<h2> Defining the Scope</h2>

	<p>Before I started coming up with sketches, I had to define my scope of  what components/pages that I wanted to redesign. Following the six questions I found on Hotjar's website allowed me to orient my focus on my redesign. </p>
	<ol>
		<li>What your website’s most valuable pages are?</li>
		<li>Who is visiting your website, and why?</li>
		<li>What propels or stops your customers?</li>
		<li>How your team/business will be impacted by the redesign? </li>
		<li>How to measure success with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)?</li>
		<li>What to change—and how to test it?</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Keeping these questions in mind, I started to go through Goldfish Tea's website to find the most important pages to customers. I found that the "Order Now" page and the "Location & Hours" section on the homepage are most important. Since they affect whether a customer can complete placing an order and when they can pick it up.</p>

	<h2>Heuristic Evaluation</h2>

	<p>To test the usability of Goldfish's website, I wanted to evaluate it using Jakob Neilsen's 10 Heuristics. To identify some the opportunity areas where the website can be improved. Some of the heuristics I have identified are shown below.</p>

	<h2> Sketches</h2>
	<p>After going through Goldfish's website, I decided to start sketching my ideas on how to make the site more enjoyable.</p>
