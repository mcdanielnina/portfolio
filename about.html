 <p>Hello there! I am a master's student at the School of Information from the University of Michigan. I am studying User Experience Design and Research.</p>

 <p> I received my B.S.E from <a href="https://umdearborn.edu/cecs/"> University of Michigan-Dearborn</a> in Industrial Systems Engineering. I was initially attracted to Industrial Systems Engineering (ISE) since it was the most diverse where I can apply engineering techniques into non-engineering settings. I also believed that it had the most human interaction of all the engineering disciplines.</p>

 <p>As I further progressed in my major and worked a few internships, I realized that ISE did improve a system for people involved, but it did not put much focus on how the peopleâ€™s behaviors/motivations influenced the output of the system. Wanting to understand more about those motivations, I also applied for a minor in Anthropology. With an Anthropology minor, I developed a holistic perspective where I can see how everything relates with one another and being able to think critically with a behavioral lens. With both Engineering and Anthropology, I want to incorporate aspects of both fields as I learn more about UX.  </p>

 <p>While learning about UX, I suddenly became hooked on the process of developing an idea from the ground up and using different techniques to make a design more user-friendly. I have always been a person who is curious and is on the lookout to learn something new. As I progress in this field, I want to continue learning and contribute my knowledge to my colleagues.</p>
